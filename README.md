# INFO605-Project
In this project, we developed and implemented a database system for an online retail store. We focused on products related to sport, such as Top (e.g T-shirts), Bottoms (e.g., tights) and shoes (e.g., running shoes), but it can be easily modified to include other types of products. The first phase was writing all the requirements and translating them into an ERD model. Next, we converted the conceptual model into a relational the relational model which includes relational schema, referential integrity and data dictionary to define the datatypes of each attribute. Based on this step, we implemented the database by writing sql create commands, and inserted data using insert commands. Finally, we tested the database by querying, deleting, and updating the database.
